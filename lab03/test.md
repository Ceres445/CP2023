# Evaluative Lab 2

## Learning objectives

* Implementing simple functions
* Using simple `if`-`else` statements
* Testing simple functions
* Incrementally developing your solution

## Starting point

The given starter code contains *skeletons* of four functions and test cases for one of them. It compiles but does not produce expected results at this point. Make sure you understand the given code.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Read the description (`@brief`) of the `base_cost` function and the given examples (`@retval`).

Implement the function `base_cost` based on this.

Make appropriate changes to `main` so you can *test* your function for different input values. (But preserve the original code for the last step.)

Run your code and make sure `base_cost` function works as expected.

### Task 2

Next, implement the `size_cost` function based on its description.

Again, make appropriate changes to `main` to test it.

### Task 3

Next, implement the `toppings_cost` function based on its description. Make appropriate changes to `main` to test it.

### Task 4

Finally, implement and test the `pizza_cost` function. The description of this function does not include `@retval` examples. So you will have to come up with test cases on your own.

### Task 5 - Sanity checks

Your final submitted code must run the *original* `main` code (with no additions/modifications).

Make sure you comment out/delete any additional code you used for testing, etc.

Here is an expected output for the completed code. Your submission will be evaluated using an automated script. If it's off even by a comma or a space, it will be marked wrong.

```txt
Enter the base type ('R' or 'T'): R
Enter the size type ('M', 'L', or 'X'): M
Enter the toppings ('C', 'V', or 'M'): C
Your bill for the RMC pizza is Rs. 130
```

## Submit

(Instructions for submission will be given in the actual lab.)
